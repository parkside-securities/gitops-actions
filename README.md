# Terraform Github Action.

This Action runs init and plan or apply against a list of directories (such as those found in `terraform-live`).  If all plans succeed, and diffs are detected, then any diff (plan -out) files are stored as artifacts in Actions.  These should be applied during the PR Merge workflow.

Additionally, any diffs or errors are included in the PR comments.
